# Machine-Learning-Projects

Project Details
This project is done to demonstrate different machine learning techniques as learned in DATS 6202- Machine Learning 1 class at the George Washington University. The focus of this project was to use real-time data to build different models.
The project is done using the Yelp Dataset available in Kaggle to build various classification models and to use the best model to predict the desired output.
Files
The project is made of two parts
Part 1: Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Analysis
• This file consists all the raw data (JSON files), converted data files (CSV files) and the Jupyter notebook with the code used to convert JSON files to CSV files.
• The file also consists of a Jupyter Notebook Python file called Data-Preprocessing and EDA. This python file has code for data cleaning, data preprocessing and Exploratory data analysis done on the data.
Part 2: Classification
• This file has a Jupyter Notebook with the code on all the classification models built and tested.
• The file contains code for logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, perceptron and support
vector machine.
Summary of Analysis
For each model accuracy, precision, recall, and run-time are calculated. The winning model is chosen in the end.
How to Run
First, Run the Data preprocessing and EDA file. This file generates a data file which is used to run the second file.
Second, Run the Classification python file to see different models build on the data.
